            SOV staked in the Bitocracy system earns voting rights weighted by
            the length of staking time. Additionally, system revenues are
            distributed on an on-going basis to those actively participating in
            governance, in relation to their voting weight. This combination of
            voting power and revenue yield, incentivizes long-term commitment
            and thinking. SOV stakeholders can choose the length of time in
            which they intend to stake their tokens (up to 36 months). They may
            also delegate their vote to other participants to incentivize
            experts to specialise in Sovryn Bitocracy.

          <p>
            SOV provides risk coverage for the protocol by acting as a pool of
            staked value that can be burned, redistributed or inflated to
            prevent and offset losses that might occur. For example, staked SOV
            can be used to create trustless BTC multisig pools (eg. for use in
            the bridge), such that theft of funds is avoided. Additionally,
            trustless BTC multisig pools (eg. for use in the bridge), such that
            theft of funds is avoided. Additionally, stakeholders who have
            staked in the Bitocracy system are incentivised to place a continued
            emphasis and investment in protocol security, lest users lose funds
            and SOV value is transferred from stakers to users to offset those
            losses.

              The heart of Sovryn is in the users who employ the product for the
              utilization of their funds. SOV will be distributed to users and
              contributors of the system via rebates, referral fees and
              liquidity mining. Tokens distributed via liquidity mining will be
              the incentivization vehicle for bringing new users and funds to
              Sovryn across multiple DeFi ecosystems. With the release of new
              products, the adoption can be used to reward the first users and
